* Op-Amp - LM324
This is the only op-amp that I was able to get on the local market, besides it may be useful for other devices. 
Although I saw on other pulse meter projects that it's probably a good idea to use two op-amps (double amplify signal).
You may reference LM324 datasheet to select something similar, for now - one op-amp will be enough, but maybe we should try to add another one too.
